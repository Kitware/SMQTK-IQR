Tutorial 1 - Demo KWCoco with Dummy Descriptors
-----------------------------------------------

This tutorial demonstrates the how to run the IQR pipeline on an arbitrary
kwcoco file, but with hand-crafted overly simplified descriptors. This means
that this tutorial does not involve any significant computation, but it still
demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline.


The script ``./run_tutorial_001.sh`` is a well-documented bash script that you
should step through manually to understand the individual steps of the process.
